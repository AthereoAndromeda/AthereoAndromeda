# Me
I'm AthereoAndromeda or Angelo (previously @redstripez08) and I started programming around the start of 2020. 

## How I Got Here
`2020` - School taught me HTML, CSS, JS. And some Lua  
`2021` - Node.js, Python, Julia, Discord bots, Arduino  
`2022-2023` - Rust, Typescript, etc.  
`2024` - NixOS  

## Things I like
- CATS !!
- Rust
- Arduino
- Raspberry Pi
- Robotics
- Configuring the hell out of my NixOS setup
- cats
- Trains

<!--
My old Bio, you treasure hunter

My interest in programming started with a project in ICT about HTML. Just pure HTML without CSS,
and I found out that I actually enjoyed coding in it. I started doing my own personal projects soon after, with HTML and CSS. After a few months, I started
doing client-side Javascript for my websites. Then I started doing Discord bots with discord.js and found that fun. And now I really enjoy programming Julia,
Python, Typescript, C#, etc. I would learn them and create personal projects with them.

I spent a lot of time programming during the COVID-19 quarantine (just look at my activity overview from that period 😅). I learned a lot of new cool stuff during that period, and found out I enjoyed writing lower-level programs more than websites and such. 

As of 2022, I've been learning Arduino, C++, Rust, and more low-level languages and concepts. These close-to-bare-metal projects are pretty interesting and neat.
