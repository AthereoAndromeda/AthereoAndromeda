# Welcome to my Profile!

I'm AthereoAndromeda (previously @redstripez08), or Angelo, and I started programming around the start of 2020. And once I learned Git, I joined GitHub on November 2020.

## Short History
My interest in programming started with a project in ICT about HTML. Just pure HTML without CSS,
and I found out that I actually enjoyed coding in it. I started doing my own personal projects soon after, with HTML and CSS. After a few months, I started
doing client-side Javascript for my websites. Then I started doing Discord bots with discord.js and found that fun. And now I really enjoy programming Julia,
Python, Typescript, C#, etc. I would learn them and create personal projects with them.

I spent a lot of time programming during the COVID-19 quarantine (just look at my activity overview from that period 😅). I learned a lot of new cool stuff during that period, and found out I enjoyed writing lower-level programs more than websites and such. 

As of 2022, I've been learning Arduino, C++, Rust, and more low-level languages and concepts. These close-to-bare-metal projects are pretty interesting and neat.
