# Welcome to my Profile!

I'm AthereoAndromeda (previously @redstripez08), or Angelo, and I started programming around the start of 2020. 

## Short History
My interest in programming started with a project in ICT about HTML. Just pure HTML without CSS,
and I found out that I actually enjoyed coding in it. I started doing my own personal projects soon after, with HTML and CSS. After a few months, I started
doing client-side Javascript for my websites. Then I started doing Discord bots with discord.js and found that fun. And now I really enjoy programming Julia,
Python, Typescript, C#, etc. I would learn them and create personal projects with them.
